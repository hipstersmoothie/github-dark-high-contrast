# github-dark-high-contrast

A theme that emulates GitHub in dark mode but with higher contrast.

Originally this was just a copy of the GitHub dark mode color theming.
Due to limitations of syntax highlighting on the web, GitHub's website syntax highlighting can't take advantage of textmate highlighting present in VSCode.
This theme uses all GitHub primer design system colors building upon VSCode's built in "High Contrast" theme.
